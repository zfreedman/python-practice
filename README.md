Repo to daily practice data structures and algorithms drills.

## Description
This repo focuses on drilling data strucutres and algorithms on a daily basis. The folders indexed by date
should contain relatively the same information. A new folder is created once all topics for data structures
and algorithms of interest have been explored.

### Data Structures

* stacks and queues
* trees, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, red/black trees
